# verdure — o2switch self-deploy (back).
#
# Run by cron every few minutes. It PULLS main and redeploys when the branch
# advanced, so nothing ever connects INTO o2switch: no SSH from a runner, no IP to
# authorise in the firewall, no manual reconnection. The front deploys separately
# on Netlify (see .github/workflows/deploy-front.yml).
#
# Migrations are NOT auto-applied: prod's drizzle journal is empty (the 26
# migrations were applied by hand via psql), so `drizzle-kit migrate` would try to
# replay all of them. So when a new commit ADDS a migration, this script parks
# (logs it, deploys nothing) until the migration is applied by hand and the clone
# advanced past it — code-only commits keep auto-deploying. Migrations are rare.
#
# One-time setup on the server — see ops/README.md.
